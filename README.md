## Self-Hosting an instance of your own

### Docker

Setting up an instance with Docker is the easiest way to set Akabot up. It's platform independent so you can start it on anything running Docker.

You can start configuring using this method [here](https://github.com/mldchan/Akabot/wiki/Self-Host-Using-Docker).

### Virtualenv

Setting up an instance with Virtualenv can be a bit more tricky, especially if the Python version is not compatible.

This method was only tested on Python 3.11 and 3.12. These versions are confirmed to be working on Windows and Linux.

You can start configuring using this method [here](https://github.com/mldchan/Akabot/wiki/Self-Host-Using-Virtualenv)
